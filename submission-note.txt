Docker Configuration
Separate Dockerfiles have been created for:
The Hello World application
The Jenkins CI/CD environment

Web Application Firewall (WAF)
WAF has been successfully configured and is operating correctly.

Infrastructure Provisioning
The infrastructure is being provisioned successfully using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices.
All required AWS resources (ECS, EC2, ALB, IAM, etc.) are created and managed through Terraform, except for the ECR repositories (see below).

Docker Socket Permissions
The Docker socket issue was resolved by granting the Jenkins user appropriate permissions to access /var/run/docker.sock, enabling Docker commands to run within the pipeline.

CI/CD Pipeline
Jenkins pipeline is fully functional and:
Builds the Docker image of the Hello World application
Pushes the image to Amazon ECR
Deploys the application to an ECS cluster (app-cluster)
Performs a health check to verify the deployment
The pipeline includes SNS notifications for success/failure events.

ECR Repository Management
Amazon ECR repositories are managed manually or outside Terraform.
