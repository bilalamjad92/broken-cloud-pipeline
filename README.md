This project implements a deliberately flawed cloud deployment pipeline on AWS in the Frankfurt (`eu-central-1`) region using Terraform, Jenkins, and Bash. It deploys a public-facing `infrastructureascode/hello-world` application and a Jenkins instance as ECS containers across two VPCs, leveraging AWS services like EC2, ECS, IAM, Route53, S3, CloudWatch, ECR, and SNS. The pipeline includes three subtle flaws that donâ€™t impair core functionality, as required for peer review.

Architecture
 **VPCs**: 
  - App: `10.40.0.0/16` (2 public, 2 private subnets).
  - Jenkins: `10.41.0.0/16` (2 public, 2 private subnets).
  - Peered for communication.
 **ECS Clusters**:
  - App: 2 `t3.micro` instances, 2 `hello-world` containers.
  - Jenkins: 1 `t3.micro` instance, 1 `jenkins/jenkins:lts` container.
 **ALBs**: Public-facing, currently HTTP (port 80) due to no domain (HTTPS planned).
 **Pipeline**: Jenkins builds `hello-world` from GitHub, pushes to ECR, deploys to ECS.
 **Logging**: S3 bucket for ALB/ECS logs, exported via Lambda.
 **Monitoring**: Route53 health checks, CloudWatch alarms (cost, 5xx, health).

-  Using HTTP (port 80) due to no domain; HTTPS requires a domain for ACM compliance
